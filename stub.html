                     Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a 
                     creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving 
                     throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute 
                     and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 
                     1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent

                     is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal 
                     or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. 
                     When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6

                     The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. 
                     of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw 
                     or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth 
                     dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from 
                     the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's 
                     control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the 
                     target can communicate telepathically with each other over 
                     any distance.<br>Whenever the charmed target takes damage, 
                     the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the 
                     effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target 
                     can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile 
                     away from the aboleth.
